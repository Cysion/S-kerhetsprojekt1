A guide on how to format text properly for the 12 Steps App:
==================================================
The text will be separated into paragraphs, headings and list items. Two of the character 'line break' ('\n\n') will be used to split the text.
- By default, all text are recognized as simple paragraphs.
- To format text as heading (level 1-3) write '#h1', '#h2' or '#h3' at the start of the line separated by blankspace.
- For list items write '*' at the start of the line separated by blankspace.
- To display five stars, like in the disclaimer section, write '#5stars' at the start of a line.

If you just want to format specific areas of text or the whole line, follow these formatting guides:
